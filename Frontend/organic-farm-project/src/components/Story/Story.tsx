        <p>The idea started when I was working at Saudi Arabia as a landscape architect. Despite having a career that is not directly related to farming, my passion towards this field made me curious about learning and researching new ways and techniques that could allow me to start my own farming project and fulfil my ambition in being a pioneer in this field. I was never a supporter of the common farming practices due to the damage caused to the surrounding ecosystem. My continuous research led me know more about the concept of ecological farming and I directly knew that this concept perfectly reflects my ideas and concerns if I were to enter this field. The next step was to follow my passion and come back to Lebanon to start my own farm and making use of my 1500 square meters land. For the past three years, I have been accumulating theoretical and practical knowledge about ecological farming. The results after three years of trial and error were extraordinary and I hope I can pass my accumulated knowledge to other fellow farmers through training and demonstration sessions so we can together promote these practices and normalize ecological farming as the best way to sustain agricultural supply while preserving the natural ecological balance.</p>
